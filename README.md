# Mice Protein Expression

Protein Expression classification models are frequently viewed not only as a difficult
task, but also as a classification problem that, in some cases, requires a trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency in analysis validation due to the large amount of data
available.
Expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control
and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess
associative learning.
The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.
Basically, this is multi-class classification problem
